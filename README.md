# Bulls and Cows Game

This is a numerical version of this old code-breaking mind game for two or more players.

The script generates a 4-digits number. The digits must be all different.

Then the player try to guess the number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls" ("muertos" in this version), if in different positions, they are "cows" ("heridos" in this version).
